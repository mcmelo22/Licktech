# Licktech

Here, we present the development of eight automated wireless cages with two drinking sippers each for rodents. Lickometers are devices that can measure the licks from rodents, and it is used in many fields of basic research. This project was developed by researchers from the Department of Psychobiology at the Federal University of São Paulo, aiming to offer a low-cost strategy.

## Development of the house cage

An acrylic house cage was designed specifically to support the two sensors of a corresponding bottle. Thus, in Figure 1, it is possible to visualize the main views.

        Figure 1. Three views from the acrylic house cage, (a) frontal, (b) lateral and (c) down.

Also, the support for the drinking sippers was planned to be removable in case the user desires to adapt the house cage for other types of sensors (Figure 2). Thus, the user can remove it and put others according to the application.

##   	Wireless central circuit
 
We also developed an electronic circuit to acquire the signals from eight house cages and send them wirelessly to a desktop computer, as shown in Figure 3.

 ## List of electronic components and costs
Below, we list all electronic components used to build one system of eight two-bottle house cages’ lickometer. The values were considered with the Brazilian currency (Real – R$) in February 2021.
